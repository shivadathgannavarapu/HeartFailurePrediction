# HeartFailurePrediction
Prediction of Heart Failure using Machine Learning

Introduction :
Heart failure is a critical medical condition that affects a significant number of individuals worldwide. Early detection and prevention of heart failure can play a crucial role in reducing its impact on patients' health and well-being. Machine learning techniques offer promising solutions for predicting heart failure based on various clinical features. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts heart failure and compare the performance of different classification algorithms.

Problem Statement :
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the occurrence of heart failure based on a set of clinical attributes. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains several features such as age, sex, blood pressure, serum creatinine levels, and more. By applying different classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), and Random Forest Classifier, we aim to identify the most accurate and reliable model for predicting heart failure.

Data Preprocessing :
Before training the machine learning models, the dataset requires preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. Feature engineering techniques can also be applied to extract additional meaningful information from the available features. This process ensures that the data is in a suitable format for training and evaluation.

Model Training and Evaluation :
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to assess the performance of the models. Each classification algorithm is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The models' hyperparameters are tuned to optimize their performance and prevent overfitting or underfitting.
Results and Discussion :
After training and evaluating the models, we compare their accuracies to identify the best-performing model for predicting heart failure. The accuracy_list obtained from the evaluation process includes the accuracy values of each model: Logistic Regression (87.78%), SVC (84.44%), KNearestNeighbors (84.44%), Decision Tree (88.89%), Naive Bayes (82.22%), and Random Forest (85.56%).
From the results, it is evident that the Decision Tree model achieved the highest accuracy of 88.89%, closely followed by Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 87.78%. These models outperformed the other algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy. The Decision Tree model's ability to capture complex relationships and provide interpretable decision rules makes it an attractive choice for understanding the factors contributing to heart failure. On the other hand, Logistic Regression offers probabilistic interpretations and can estimate the risk of heart failure, making it a valuable model for risk assessment.

Conclusion : 
In conclusion, this project successfully developed a machine learning model to predict heart failure based on clinical attributes. The Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models demonstrated strong performance, with the Decision Tree model achieving the highest accuracy. The selection between these two models depends on factors such as interpretability requirements and the need for probabilistic interpretations. The other models, including SVC, KNearestNeighbors, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, also showed reasonably good accuracies but were slightly lower than the top two models. The choice of the best model depends on the specific needs, interpretability, and constraints of the project.
Overall, this project contributes to the field of healthcare by providing a reliable and accurate method for predicting heart failure. The developed machine learning model can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of heart failure and enable early intervention and preventive measures.
